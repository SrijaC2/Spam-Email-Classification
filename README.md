# 📧 Spam Email Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

This project builds a **Spam Email Classifier** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Naive Bayes** machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam.

---

## 🚀 Approach

- Loaded and cleaned email dataset (`spam.csv`)
- Converted text data into numerical features using **CountVectorizer**
- Trained a **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

---

## 📊 Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** `97.84%`
- **Precision (Spam):** `91%`
- **Recall (Spam):** `93%`
- **F1-score (Spam):** `92%`

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix visualization
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

---

## 📌 Conclusion

The model demonstrates high accuracy and reliability in detecting spam emails, making it effective for real-world email filtering tasks.
